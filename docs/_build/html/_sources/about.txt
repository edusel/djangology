Grout is a product development web application built using the
`Django Framework <https://www.djangoproject.com>`_.

The design goals for this project are:

- Integrate design rules into the design process.
- Manage as little information as possible regarding product development.
- Create an explicit release structure that allows team members to coordinate sales, engineering and manufacturing activities.
