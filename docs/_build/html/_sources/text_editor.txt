****************
Atom Text Editor
****************

For this setup, I will be using the `Atom <https:atom.io>`_ text editor. After installing the text editor, set it up as you wish or install the `sync-settings <https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings>`_ package to back up an existing setup.

.. NOTE::

    If you want to peruse my atom backup, it can be found here on `GitHub <https://gist.github.com/edusel/bce97b92239890b909a66a9f83ac8fb6>`_
