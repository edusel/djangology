OK, so how is the page you're reading created? Using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

Install the python package for Sphinx using pip within your virtual environment in order to get setup:
::

    $ pip install sphinx

From your main project directory, create a documents folder:
::

    $ mkdir docs

Navigate to the docs directory and run the quick start to get movin':
::

    $ sphinx-quickstart

The theme is the standard `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ format. It can be found `here <http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/tools/sphinx-themes/>`_ along with other great options.
